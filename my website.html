<p>Thanks for checking out my website! I hope you enjoy your stay, and perhaps learn something about me.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Jesse Attard and I am currently studying at RMIT University for a Bachelor in Information Technology. My Student number is<em>&nbsp;s3784932</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and my email address is&nbsp;<em>s3784932@student.rmit.edu.au.&nbsp;</em>My nationality is Australian, however both of my grandparents were born in Malta.To date, my education only involves my completion of VCE. English is the only language that I can speak.</p>
<p>I can't really think of any interesting facts about myself, but I do have a dog; Her name is <em>Lily and she is a Malteze Shih Tzu</em></p>
<p>I have provided a picture of myself as reference.</p>

<h3>My interest in IT</h3>
<p>I have had an interest in IT for a long time. My interest in IT sparked when I was around 6 years old, and began playing an online Disney game which is now shut down. Ever since then, I have been frequently using computers. I have IT experience from completing units 1-4 of&nbsp;<em>VCE: Information Technology.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>I chose to go to RMIT for many reasons; It's easy to get to, lots of my friends go to RMIT and I've heard many good things. During my studies at&nbsp;RMIT, I hope to learn relevant computer knowledge that I can use in my future job, as well as better communication and team skills.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>I have always known that I wanted a job in IT; however that is a very broad statement, I never actually knew what specific field I was interested in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>After looking at all available options, I made the decision that for now I was interested in being a developer. The position is appealing to me as I like the idea of a job where I can just sit down and get shit done. It also involves a lot of meetings and teamwork, which I find appealing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>To excel in this job, I need experience in many areas of development such as experience with: <em>Java 8</em>, <em>Spring Framework</em>, <em>Windows</em> and <em>Linux</em>, etc. Currently, I have little experience in these areas, I do however have experience in using <em>Windows</em>, and I plan to learn lots about <em>Java</em> through 3 years of programming in my course. Obviously I will not be able to learn all of these skills just from one degree, and will have to extend my knowledge through other sources such as <em>YouTube</em> and online learning platforms.</blockquote>
<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<p>To find out my personality, I completed 3 tests on the internet&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16Personalities Test</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://scontent.fmel8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/56429266_397359497753504_3362395278878441472_n.png?_nc_cat=105&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fmel8-1.fna&amp;oh=4b553c4028ce268049bdedc2e13f2df6&amp;oe=5D454F49" alt="test1" width="385" height="252" /></p>
<p><strong>Educationplanner Learning style test&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://scontent.fmel8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/56119385_440162983390669_1004599451899133952_n.png?_nc_cat=104&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fmel8-1.fna&amp;oh=ef06644bf920ffbc859557a7725eedcc&amp;oe=5D41A10A" alt="test2" width="441" height="142" /></strong></p>
<p>and&nbsp;<strong>Big Five's Personality Test</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://scontent.fmel8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/55646632_405802330231926_4382142934401679360_n.png?_nc_cat=104&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fmel8-1.fna&amp;oh=4613a7c5c0f0d6fc0b73925d89f7ab76&amp;oe=5D08A7DF" alt="test3" width="561" height="138" /></strong></p>
<p>I think that these results are pretty accurate. I agree with the first test stating that I'm 35% introverted, the second test saying that I don't have a specific learning style, and the third test saying that I'm pretty agreeable.</p>
<p><em>How would these results affect your behaviour in a team?</em></p>
<p>It is kind of hard to say how these results will affect my behaviour in a team, but perhaps my supposed assertiveness may be of value when it comes to making decisions. My agreeableness will also be helpful when it comes to listening to others views and suggestions, making group work easier.</p>
<p><em>How will you take this into consideration when forming a team?</em></p>
<p>When forming a team, I hope to find people who are also quite agreeable, so the group will be able compromise and create a product that everyone can agree on. Other than that, I don't really know how I would use these tests while creating a group.</p>
<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>My project involves the idea of a Chat bot for RMIT related questions. While there is an FAQ, there is only a few questions on the page, and doesn't cover nearly as much questions as there are being asked. As time progresses and more questions are asked, the bot will be updated with all of the new information. As we have already created a chat bot, this project should be much easier than any other java related projects that I could have chosen.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I feel that this project will be of use as I had trouble with my student card at the start of the year and I noticed the waiting queue for RMIT Connect was pretty large, suggesting they were busy. If this system were in place, it could save both the user and the people at RMIT connect time. It will also mean that the same questions will be repeated a lot less often.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>If the Chatbot were to be a success it could potentially be a part of the RMIT website.</p>
<p>It will start off with a user asking a question to RMIT Connect. Then, RMIT connect will attempt to answer the users question to the best of their ability. If RMIT Connect is able to successfully answer the users question, the answer and the question will be added to a database alongside other questions and answers.</p>
<p>To prevent answers stacking up, the person at RMIT Connect will have the option on whether or not to add the question to the database. If it is a unique question and they do wish to add it to the database, all they will have to do is press a button that comes up after the chat with the student has ended. Now if another user has the same question, they can use the Chat bot and type it in. Upon pressing enter, the bot will scan the database for relevant key words, then the user will be granted with every question that has the given Key word in it, such as 'Student Card'.</p>
<p>The bot will list every question with that Key word in a response box, alongside a number.</p>
<p>EG. 1. How do I get my student card?</p>
<p>To choose the question that is most relevant to the user, they will have to type the corresponding number to the question. When the user does this, the bot will display the answer to the question the user was looking for, once again in a response box. If the user types in a question but no Key words are recognized, the bot will tell the user &ldquo;Sorry, but we do not recognize your Question. Please seek further help on RMIT Connect.&ldquo; If the user is unsure how the bot works, there will be a Button labelled '?'. When pressed or hovered, it will bring up a message which reads &ldquo;Hello! Please type your question in the input box, and we will scan our database to see if this question has been answered before. The Chat bot will aim to be accessible on all sorts of devices and screens. There will need to be someone who checks the database regularly, as questions are likely to repeat, despite the button where the user decides whether or not to add the query to the database.</p>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>For the Chatbot itself, Java will be used as I am familiar with it, and it is likely the most optimal programming language for this situation. All of the data that is gathered from usage of RMIT Connect and the Chat bot will be stored in Oracle as a Relational Database. HTML will also be used as the Chat bot will be running on the RMIT website. The data for the database will be stored on a hard drive, and backed up on a cloud server to ensure that the risk of data loss is minimized.</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>There are quite a few skills needed for this project to work optimally. Skill in Java will be needed, as the Chat bot will be complicated due to all of the possible entries from the user. Knowledge in Relational Databases and Oracle is also necessary, as there will be a lot of data to manage, and it will be regularly updated. It will be quite difficult to learn these skills, as java can be quite complicated, as can large relational databases storing large amounts of updating information.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The hopeful outcome of this project is that there will be an easier, new way for the user to find out the solutions to the problems they are having. If the Chat bot functions correctly, it will ensure that RMIT Connect can answer more questions and be less busy, and it will also ensure that the user saves time and will not have to wait in a queue just to resolve a question that has already been answered. To summarize, the Chat bot is an attempt to reduce the traffic on the RMIT Connect website.</p>
